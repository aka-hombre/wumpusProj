This our Python implementation of the Wumpus World game.
Requirements:
Python 3.6+

The game takes place in a 4x4 grid where an agent navigates the world,
avoiding pits and the Wumpus, while trying to find the gold.

Files:
agent.py: Contains the Agent class, which controls the movement and memory of the agent as it explores the world.

env.py: Defines the RoomClass and World classes, which represent the rooms in the grid and the world layout.
It also handles the environment setup and room interactions.

main.py: Implements the probability calculation and agent movement in the environment, serving as the main game logic.
